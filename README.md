# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Effigy, got up with clothing
Abstracted from the victim’s room,
Is raised aloft to cheers of loathing
Before it meets a flaming doom.

The Fetishist gets out the hassock,
Turns down the lamp, and bolts the door;
Then in galoshes and a cassock.
He worships it upon the floor.

The Governess up in the attic
Attempts to make a cup of tea;
Her mind grows daily more erratic
From cold and hunger and ennui.

The Hermit lives among the boulders,
He wears no garment but a sack;
By slow degrees his reason boulders,
The sun has long since burnt him black.

The Keeper, when it’s time for luncheon,
Flings down his charge upon the bed,
And taking out a home-made truncheon,
Belabors him about the head.

The Ressurectionist goes plying
Without ado his simple trade;
Material is always dying
And got with nothing but a spade.

The Xenophobe grabs at the table,
He feels his toes and fingers curl;
For he is only barely able
To keep from striking down the girl.

The Yegg on rubber soles comes creeping
Inside the house when it is late,
And while the occupants are sleeping,
Removes the heirlooms and the plate.
